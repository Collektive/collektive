# What is Collektive?

Collektive is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of resilient and
scalable distributed systems through the principles of Aggregate Programming.

---

## What is the Purpose of Collektive?

The primary purpose of Collektive is to provide developers with a robust framework to design and implement self-organizing
collective behaviors in dynamic and distributed environments.
It abstracts away the complexities of low-level device interactions and communication,
allowing users to focus on high-level coordination logic.

---

## What Problems does Collektive solve?

### Complex Coordination

Collektive addresses the challenge of coordinating large-scale systems,
such as sensor networks,
drone swarms,
or IoT devices,
where nodes operate autonomously but must collectively achieve global objectives.

### Scalability

By leveraging Aggregate Programming,
Collektive ensures that applications scale seamlessly as the number of devices increases.

### Resilience

Collektive provides mechanisms to maintain system stability and adapt to changes,
such as node failures,
communication delays,
or environmental variability.

---

## Why Collektive?

### High-Level Abstraction

Collektive simplifies the implementation of distributed behaviors,
allowing developers to express coordination logic concisely without managing individual device states.

### Declarative Programming

The library promotes a declarative approach,
enabling developers to describe what the system should achieve,
while Collektive handles how at runtime.

### Dynamic Adaptation

Applications built with Collektive can react dynamically to network changes or external inputs,
ensuring robustness in unpredictable environments.

## Potential Applications of Collektive

The Collektive library is particularly well-suited for addressing challenges in the following domains:

- **Internet of Things Systems Management**
- **Swarm Robotics**
- **Crowd Management**
- **Self-Healing Distributed Systems**
- **Simulation of Natural and Biological Processes**

### Proven Applications

Collektive has already been applied successfully in domains vascular morphogenesis,
demonstrating its utility in modeling self-organizing biological processes[^1].
