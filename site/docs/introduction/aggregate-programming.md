# The Challenge of Maintaining Distributed Systems 

The **progressive increase** in the number of interconnected devices, leads to a **rise in the costs** associated with maintaining distributed systems. This creates **significant challenges** in implementing software services on a **global scale** using the traditional approach of individually programming each agent. This situation drives the search for solutions aimed at improving the **autonomy** of computing systems and **reducing their complexity**.

## Aggregate Programming as a Relevant Approach

In this context, **aggregate programming** emerges as a relevant approach. It is based on the **functional composition** of **reusable collective behavior blocks**, with the goal of efficiently achieving **complex** and **resilient behaviors** in **dynamic networks**.

### Key Properties of Aggregate Programming

- **Self-stabilization**
- **Independence from density**

These properties are initially studied on **basic building blocks**, such as:
- **Broadcasting**
- **Distance estimation**
- **Data aggregation**

These building blocks are then transferred and validated on more **complex systems** created through **functional composition**.

### Conceptual Roots in Field Calculus

Aggregate programming finds its **conceptual roots** in **Field Calculus**.
