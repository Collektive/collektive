**Collektive** is composed of several independent components:

- The core _DSL_ (Domain Specific Language) defining the language syntax and semantics.
- The _compiler plugin_ used to automatically devise the communication protocol based on the program's structure.
- The _stdlib_ (Standard Library) providing common functionalities and data structures.

**Collektive** is designed to be used in a **multiplatform** environment,
allowing you to run the same code on different platforms (JVM, JS, Native) with minimal changes,
and uses **Gradle** as build system.
Even though **Collektive** is designed to be used in a multiplatform environment,
it can also be used in a single platform environment (e.g., JVM only).

## Compiler plugin setup

To use **Collektive** in your project, first add the **compiler plugin** to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("multiplatform") version "<kotlin_version>"
    id("it.unibo.collektive.collektive-plugin") version "<latest version>"
}
```

:::danger
The **compiler plugin** it's a mandatory component of the **Collektive** ecosystem. It is used to automatically devise
the communication protocol based on the program's structure.

Without this plugin, the program will **NOT** run as expected at runtime.
:::

## Dependencies setup
To start you app development, add the `dsl` and (optionally) the `stdlib` dependencies to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="multiplatform" label="Multiplatform">

```kotlin
kotlin {
    jvm()
    js()
    ...
    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation("it.unibo.collektive:collektive-dsl:<latest version>")
                implementation("it.unibo.collektive:collektive-stdlib:<latest version>")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="jvm" label="JVM only">

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("it.unibo.collektive:collektive-dsl:<latest version>")
    implementation("it.unibo.collektive:collektive-stdlib:<latest version>")
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip[**Collektive** :heart: Kotlin Multiplatform]

**Collektive** supports [KMP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-intro.html) (Kotlin Multiplatform) projects, allowing you to use the DSL in Native, JS, and JVM environments.       
Currently, the following platforms are supported:
- **JVM**
- **JS** (node.js and browser)
- **Native** (iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows)
:::

:::info[Note]
Collektive is a language and as such it must be executed in an environment that supports it.
We suggest getting familiar with the tool by starting with one of our [template repositories](../../references/#template-repositories).
