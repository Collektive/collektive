### Device Counter
Let's create a program where *each device* learns the total number of devices in the network.

We can use the [countDevices](https://javadoc.io/doc/it.unibo.collektive/collektive-stdlib/latest/collektive-stdlib/it.unibo.collektive.stdlib.accumulation/count-devices.html)
function from the standard library,
which relies on a [hopDistance](https://javadoc.io/doc/it.unibo.collektive/collektive-stdlib/latest/collektive-stdlib/it.unibo.collektive.stdlib.spreading/hop-distance-to.html) metric.
This function is based on the [convergeCast](https://javadoc.io/doc/it.unibo.collektive/collektive-stdlib/latest/collektive-stdlib/it.unibo.collektive.stdlib.accumulation/converge-cast.html) operation,
which aggregates values towards the root device in the network.

```kotlin file=<rootDir>/static/code/FirstCollektiveProgram.kt#L1-L7
```

:::note
With our goal in mind,
this implementation has a limitation: only the root device will know the number of devices in the network.
:::

We now need to propagate the information accumulated by the root device to all other devices in the network.
How?
By broadcasting the value with the [gradientCast](https://javadoc.io/doc/it.unibo.collektive/collektive-stdlib/latest/collektive-stdlib/it.unibo.collektive.stdlib.spreading/gradient-cast.html) function,
which propagates it across multiple spanning trees,
starting from the root.

```kotlin file=<rootDir>/static/code/FirstCollektiveProgram.kt#L9-L18
```

The following is the program that each device will execute:

```kotlin file=<rootDir>/static/code/FirstCollektiveProgram.kt#L20-L30
```

Now all the devices in the network will know how many devices are currently connected.

:::caution
What happens if a group of devices or the root gets disconnected from the network,
or the network becomes segmented?
:::

In such a case,
the subnetwork that still contains the root device will continue to compute the updated number of devices.
However,
any subnetworks that no longer include the root will not be able to do so.

How can we address this issue?
We can use a **leader election algorithm**,
which allows us to dynamically elect a new root device within each connected component of the network.
In this tutorial,
we use the [boundedElection](https://javadoc.io/doc/it.unibo.collektive/collektive-stdlib/latest/collektive-stdlib/it.unibo.collektive.stdlib.consensus/bounded-election.html) function from the standard library.

```kotlin file=<rootDir>/static/code/FirstCollektiveProgram.kt#L32-L44
```

:::tip[Success]
Now we're all set!
The final program will recompute the number of devices in the network, even if the network becomes segmented.
