## Fields

The `Field` is a data structure that maps for each device inside a neighborhood[^1],
the device's ID to its local value.[^2]

Each field contains the `ID` of the device itself as well as its **local value**,
and the IDs of the neighbors and their values.
For example, the field shared by an isolated device with ID `0` in a network is:
```
ϕ(localId=0, localValue=0, neighbors={})
```
Note that, hence no neighbors are present, the `neighbors` value is empty.

Suppose that there are three devices all connected to each other:

![](/img/devices.svg)

Device with ID `0` has a local value of `5`,
device with ID `1` has a local value of `10`,
and device with ID `2` has a local value of `15`.

Considering the following `exchange` program:
```kotlin
exchange(initialValue) { field -> field }
```

These are the fields that each device perceives:
```
ϕ(localId=0, localValue=5, neighbors={1=10, 2=15}) // field perceived by device 0
ϕ(localId=1, localValue=10, neighbors={0=5, 2=15}) // field perceived by device 1
ϕ(localId=2, localValue=15, neighbors={0=5, 1=10}) // field perceived by device 2
```

Notice how the values of the neighbors are included in the field.

Now, let's consider a more complex scenario with four devices, where the device with ID `3` has as neighbor only the device with ID `0`:

![](/img/four-devices.svg)

With the same `exchange` program as before, the fields perceived by each device are:
```
ϕ(localId=0, localValue=5, neighbors={1=10, 2=15, 3=20}) // field perceived by device 0
ϕ(localId=1, localValue=10, neighbors={0=5, 2=15}) // field perceived by device 1
ϕ(localId=2, localValue=15, neighbors={0=5, 1=10}) // field perceived by device 2
ϕ(localId=3, localValue=20, neighbors={0=5}) // field perceived by device 3
```
Note now that the device with ID `3` has only one neighbor, the device with ID `0`,
thus device `0` is the only one that has the device with ID `3` in its neighborhood,
while device `3` has just the device with ID `0` in its neighborhood.

[^1]: The neighborhood is the set of devices that are directly connected to a given device.
[^2]: This is the definition of `field` inside Collektive, its definition from the Aggregate Computing perspective is slightly different.

## Aggregate Operators

The main operators of the `DSL` that can manipulate fields are:

### Exchange

[`exchange`](https://javadoc.io/doc/it.unibo.collektive/dsl/latest/dsl/it.unibo.collektive.aggregate.api/-aggregate/exchange.html)
is the foundation of `XC`[^3],
has the crucial aspect that can send different values to each neighbor,
allowing custom interaction between them.
It models the space-time evolution of the device.

#### Example


```kotlin
// when the id of the device is even,
// add 1 to the value perceived, else double the value.
exchange(initialValue) { field ->
    field.mapWithId { id, value ->
        if (id % 2 == 0) value + 1 else value * 2
    }
}
```
After each iteration of every device, the resultant fields are the following:

```
ϕ(localId=0, localValue=5, neighbors={})
ϕ(localId=1, localValue=10, neighbors={0=6})
ϕ(localId=2, localValue=15, neighbors={0=6, 1=20})
ϕ(localId=3, localValue=20, neighbors={0=6, 1=20, 2=16})
```

### Neighboring

[`neighboring`](https://javadoc.io/doc/it.unibo.collektive/dsl/latest/dsl/it.unibo.collektive.aggregate.api/-aggregate/neighboring.html)
allows to access the values of the neighbours and send them information.

### Evolve

[`evolve`](https://javadoc.io/doc/it.unibo.collektive/dsl/latest/dsl/it.unibo.collektive.aggregate.api/-aggregate/evolve.html)
allows to model the state evolution of the device over time.
