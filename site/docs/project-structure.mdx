## Project submodules

The Collektive project is organized into several submodules, each serving a distinct role:

- **collektive-dsl**: the core implementation of the Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for aggregate computing,
    exposing the operators and logic for this programming paradigm.
- **collektive-stdlib**: a standard library providing essential functions and utilities to support aggregate computing operations.
- **collektive-compiler-plugin** is divided into two components:
  - **frontend**: checks for dangerous or inappropriate code written using the Collektive DSL
  - **backend**: a compiler plugin that modifies a data structure used to track the runtime stack.
        Each time a function is called, its name is registered in this structure.
- **collektive-compiler-embeddable**:
  - **compiler-embedded**: an embeddable version of the compiler designed for integration into other projects.
    This allows developers to leverage the compilerâ€™s capabilities directly within their applications,
    making it easier to extend and customize compilation features.
- **collektive-gradle-plugin**: a necessary plugin that allows Gradle projects to include and apply the compiler plugin.
- **alchemist-incarnation-collektive**: an incarnation of Collektive for the Alchemist simulator,
  which is a simulation framework for distributed systems.
