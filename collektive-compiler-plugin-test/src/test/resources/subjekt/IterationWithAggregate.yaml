        Aggregate function '${{ AGGREGATE }}' is called inside a loop without explicit alignment.
        This may cause the same execution path to trigger multiple interactions, resulting in ambiguous alignment.
        Wrap the function call using ''alignedOn'' with a unique key to ensure consistent alignment.
